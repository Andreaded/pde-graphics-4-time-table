# processing-graphics-assignment-4-time-table

**[Assignment Standard Operating Procedures](https://mariopineda.github.io/assignment-sops/)**

In this assignment you will be creating a daily time table of your classes similar to the format QE uses ([see example here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxBFLDWev1vESHBoLXZha2YzbkE/view), note that the time table you are creating will only be for a single day).

1. Each rectangle has to include the class name and the teacher's name. Store the names of all of your current teachers in separate strings called `teacher1`, `teacher2` and `teacher3`, etc.  Store the names of one of their classes as additional Strings called ```course1```, ```course2``` and ```course3```, etc.
2. Using lines or rectangles, set up a grid for a 1 day time table. This will essentially be a 2x4 table (or something similar) be sure to make the boxes big enough to fit in your course names. Colours are optional.
3. Use ```text()``` statements that use the above variables to print out the information into the time table. You may also add room numbers (optional). One possible layout is the following:

## Bonus Challenge
Create the 2x4 grid using for loops.
